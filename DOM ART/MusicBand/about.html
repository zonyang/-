				<p>Dashing through the snow</p>
				<p>In a one- horse open sleighOver the fields we goLaughing all the wayBells on bobtails ringMaking spirits brightWhat fun it is to ride and singA sleighing song tonight.OH,Jingle bells, jingle bells,Jingle all the wayOh,what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleighJingle bells,jingle bellsJingle all the way. Oh,what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two agoI thought I take a rideAnd soon Miss Fanny Brightwas seated by my sideThe horse was lean and lankMisfortune seemed his lotHe's got into a drifted bankAnd we, we got upsot. OH,Jingle bells, jingle bells,Jingle all the wayOh,what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleighJingle bells,jingle bellsJingle all the way. Oh,what fun it is to rideIn a one-horse open sleigh. A day or two ago,The story I must tellI went out on the snow,And on my back I fell;A gent was riding byIn a one-horse open sleigh,He laughed as there I sprawling lie,But quickly drove away.</p>
